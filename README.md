A 53 foot dry van is the most common trailer that is attached to a tractor for truck cargo in North
America. If you open the doors, remove the roof, and look at it from above it forms a U-shape with the
open doors at the top and the closed end that attaches to the tractor at the boƩom.
Our dry van is 10 feet wide by 53 feet deep and represented by a two-dimensional grid. The width is
along the x-axis, with the left wall at the left of coordinate 0 and right wall to the right of coordinate 9.

The depth of the trailer is along the y-axis, with the closed end of the trailer at the boƩom of the y-
coordinate 0 and the open end at 52.

This program loads cargo into the trailer. The cargo shapes and names are given below. Your
program will accept a cargo shape and x-axis location in a series of records in the form: “3O,9I,0J”.
Cargo is loaded straight in from the open end (top) to the empty end (boƩom). The cargo cannot be
rotated, and it does not move on the x-axis.
